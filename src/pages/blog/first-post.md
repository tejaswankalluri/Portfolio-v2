## 1. Consistency

You need to be consistent while programming. Do not take programming as a subject take it as a hobby. Practice it like cricket.
Practice it every day, spend some time on coding take it as a hobby
I see many people that they start programming today and they never touch for a week
Or month. So be consistent
When you learn something in programming, do code on the laptop or a computer.
Because there will be a difference between playing cricket at home VS stadium. The stadium for programming is a laptop or computer. So be practical

## 2. Time management for college students

You have to manage both the college syllabus and programming, so You need time management to do both things, so that's why I recommend you plan a reasonable timetable.

## 3. Do not learn multiple languages. Be master at one language

If you learned c, c++, Java, and any other languages, that doesn't mean you are a good programmer.

If you know at least one language but if you are master at that language, that means you have more value than the person who knows 5 to 10 languages.

## 4. Makings projects

I see many students learn about programming, but they won't do projects in that particular language they have learned. **This is similar: You know how to use a gun, but you don't know how to aim the target.**
so by doing projects will make you more comfortable at programming

## 5. Don't be in a tutorial hell

While we are learning, we learn from college or from the internet like YouTube, articles by this you will be in tutorial hell once you learn basics of your favorite language try to do projects by yourself. It makes you more confident.

**This is what I have learned from programming for the past six years**
